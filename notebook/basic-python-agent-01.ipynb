Save the code below (for example, as transpose.sh), make it executable (chmod +x transpose.sh), and run it with a matrix string as its only argument.\\n\\nBelow is the complete script:\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n#!/bin/bash\\n# Usage: ./transpose.sh \\'[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]\\'\\n\\nif [ \"$#\" -ne 1 ]; then\\n  echo \"Usage: $0 \\'&lt;matrix&gt;\\'\"\\n  exit 1\\nfi\\n\\n# Get the input matrix string.\\nmatrix_str=\"$1\"\\n\\n# Remove an outer leading \"[\" and trailing \"]\" if present.\\n# For input like \"[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]\" these are removed.\\ntrimmed=$(echo \"$matrix_str\" | sed \\'s/^\\\\[//; s/\\\\]$//\\')\\n\\n# Split the matrix into rows.\\n# Each row is originally enclosed in brackets, now removed.\\n# We assume rows are separated by \"],[\"\\nIFS=\"],[\" read -ra rows &lt;&lt;&lt; \"$trimmed\"\\n\\n# Determine the number of rows.\\nnum_rows=${#rows[@]}\\n\\n# Get the number of columns from the first row.\\nIFS=\\',\\' read -ra first_row &lt;&lt;&lt; \"${rows[0]}\"\\nnum_cols=${#first_row[@]}\\n\\n# Create an array to hold the rows of the transposed matrix.\\ntransposed=()\\n\\n# For each column in the original matrix,\\n# collect the corresponding element from each row.\\nfor (( col=0; col&lt;num_cols; col++ )); do\\n  new_row=\"\"\\n  for (( row=0; row&lt;num_rows; row++ )); do\\n    # Split the current row by comma to get its elements.\\n    IFS=\\',\\' read -ra elements &lt;&lt;&lt; \"${rows[row]}\"\\n    # Trim any accidental spaces.\\n    elem=$(echo \"${elements[col]}\" | xargs)\\n    # Build the new row string (comma-separated).\\n    if [ \"$row\" -eq 0 ]; then\\n      new_row=\"$elem\"\\n    else\\n      new_row=\"$new_row,$elem\"\\n    fi\\n  done\\n  # Save the new row.\\n  transposed+=(\"$new_row\")\\ndone\\n\\n# Build a string for the transposed matrix in the same format.\\nresult=\"\"\\nfor (( i=0; i&lt;${#transposed[@]}; i++ )); do\\n  if [ \"$i\" -eq 0 ]; then\\n    result=\"[$(echo \"${transposed[i]}\")]\"\\n  else\\n    result=\"$result,[$(echo \"${transposed[i]}\")]\"\\n  fi\\ndone\\n\\n# Print the result.\\necho \"$result\"\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHow it works:\\n1. The script first strips any leading or trailing outer brackets.\\n2. It splits the string into rows using IFS with the delimiter \"],[\"\\n3. For each column index it builds a new “row” gathering that column’s element from every row (which is the definition of the transpose).\\n4. Finally, it prints the transposed matrix in the same [a,b],[c,d] format.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n$ ./transpose.sh \\'[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]\\'\\n[1,3,5],[2,4,6]\\n\\nThis script meets the requirements.'</span>,\n",

      "### Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents a monumental leap in technological evolution, where machines possess the capability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a wide range of tasks, much like a human. Unlike Narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, such as language translation or image recognition, AGI aims to replicate the broad adaptability of human intelligence. The emergence of AGI holds the potential to revolutionize multiple sectors, including healthcare, transportation, and education, by introducing unprecedented efficiencies and capabilities. This essay will explore AGI's evolution, characteristics, current development efforts, challenges, and potential impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Historical Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The journey toward AGI begins with the origin of artificial intelligence itself. Initially conceptualized during the mid-20th century, AI has made significant progress through key milestones like the development of expert systems in the 1970s and the advent of machine learning in the 1980s and 1990s, culminating in breakthroughs in deep learning. These advancements have paved the way towards AGI, reflecting a gradual yet persistent aspiration to develop systems capable of comprehensive learning and reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Characteristics of AGI\n",
      "\n",
      "AGI's defining feature is its human-like understanding, which enables it to perform any intellectual task a human can, including problem-solving, reasoning, and adapting to new situations. This adaptability extends to autonomous decision-making, where AGI systems should not only predict outcomes but also make decisions without human intervention, thereby reshaping decision-making processes across industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Current Approaches to AGI\n",
      "\n",
      "The pursuit of AGI employs diverse methodologies, including the top-down symbolic approach, which emphasizes high-level human-like reasoning, and the bottom-up connectionist approach, focusing on neural networks that mimic human brain function. Major research projects, such as OpenAI's initiatives and Google's DeepMind, exemplify concerted efforts to overcome existing barriers. These projects leverage substantial computational resources and cutting-edge algorithms in the quest for AGI.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Challenges to Developing AGI\n",
      "\n",
      "Developing AGI is fraught with technical challenges, notably the need for immense computational power and the comprehensive understanding of human cognition. Furthermore, ethical and social issues, such as ensuring AGI alignment with human values, safety, and the broader societal impact, loom large. Scholars like Nick Bostrom and Stuart Russell have extensively discussed these aspects, emphasizing the need for alignment and control to mitigate risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Impacts of AGI\n",
      "\n",
      "AGI's potential to transform society is immense, with implications spanning numerous fields. In healthcare, AGI could provide highly accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans, while in transportation, it could lead to fully autonomous systems capable of reshaping urban planning. However, the economic implications, notably shifts in employment and economic structures, could be profound, necessitating new models of work and economic resilience as highlighted by the World Economic Forum.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Future Outlook\n",
      "\n",
      "Predicting AGI's arrival remains speculative, with estimates ranging from the next few decades to longer-term horizons. A prudent approach advocates for robust regulatory and legal frameworks to manage risks and harness AGI's benefits effectively. Collaboration among international bodies, as proposed by the AI Now Institute and the Partnership on AI, will be crucial in shaping and governing AGI's integration into societal structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, AGI presents a transformative vision for the future, combining potential prosperity with significant challenges. The balance between optimism and caution will be pivotal as the technological community moves closer to realizing AGI. Continued exploration, rigorous debate, and strategic preparation will determine AGI's role in shaping the future.\n",
