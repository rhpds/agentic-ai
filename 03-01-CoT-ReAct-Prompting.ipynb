      "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the elevation range of an area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into. First, I need to make sure I understand what the Colorado orogeny is. I remember that orogeny refers to a mountain-building event. The Colorado orogeny was an ancient geological process that affected the region in the US where the Colorado Plateau is now. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the Colorado orogeny is related to the Ancestral Rocky Mountains. Let me confirm that. A quick search in my mind... Yes, the Colorado orogeny happened during the Paleozoic era, leading to the uplift of areas that would later form parts of the Rocky Mountains. The eastern sector of this orogeny probably extends into certain regions. The user is asking which area it extends into and what the elevation range of that area is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the Colorado Plateau is a stable region with high elevations, but I'm not sure if that's where the eastern sector extends into. I should check the specific regions affected by the Colorado orogeny. The eastern sector might affect areas in Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, perhaps even Texas. \n",
      "\n",
      "I recall that the Ancestral Rockies were eroded away, but their uplift influenced the deposition of sediments in surrounding basins. The area affected by the eastern sector might be the Appalachian Basin? But I'm not certain. Wait, the Appalachian Mountains are in the eastern US, but the Colorado orogeny is in the west. Maybe it's the Illinois Basin? No, I need to get this right. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny could extend into the Great Plains region. The Great Plains in the central US are relatively flat and have lower elevations. The elevation range there is generally between 1,000 to 5,000 feet (300 to 1,500 meters), but I need to confirm if that's the area the question refers to. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the problem is that the user is asking for the elevation range of the area into which the eastern sector extends, not the orogeny itself. So I need to first identify which area is affected by the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking up some geological resources... The Colorado orogeny is part of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains, whose eastern sector extended into what is now Texas and Oklahoma. The uplift during this orogeny affected the surrounding sedimentary basins. The area that got extended into by the eastern sector would be the Midland Basin or the Delaware Basin in Texas, perhaps? Those areas are in the Permian Basin. But I need to check if that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the Permian Basin is a sedimentary basin, so it might be related to the orogenic activity. However, the Permian Basin is in Texas and New Mexico. The elevation range there is generally lower, as it's a basin. However, I need to find the elevation range of the area into which the eastern sector extended.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the eastern sector extended into Texas, then perhaps the elevation range of that area is relatively low. The Permian Basin's elevation is around 1,500 to 2,500 feet (450 to 750 meters). But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to refer to the Appalachian Basin again. Wait, the Appalachian Basin is in the eastern US, which is further from Colorado.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another angle: The Colorado orogeny caused the formation of the Ancestral Rockies, and the eastern part of that would be in the area that now is the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma, possibly into Kansas. The elevation range here would be part of the Great Plains. The Great Plains in the central US have elevations ranging from around 1,000 feet (300 meters) in the east to over 6,000 feet (1,800 meters) in the west. So if the eastern sector extended into parts of the Great Plains, the elevation range would depend on the specific region affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the area in question is the basin that was influenced by the orogeny's uplift. For instance, the uplift might have created a basin that was filled with sediments from the eroded mountains. The basin's elevation range would then vary. Let me think of specific places. The Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma is a sedimentary basin that was influenced by the Ancestral Rockies. The elevation there could be as low as 800 feet (240 meters) in the basin to higher elevations around the edges. However, this is getting into more specific geological knowledge, which I might not have in detail. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since I'm a bit uncertain about the exact area, I need to structure my answer step by step. First, identify the area into which the eastern sector extends. Then determine its elevation range. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the most probable answer based on available knowledge.\n",
