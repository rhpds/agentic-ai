    "We have seen now how a so called output by AI can be cross checked. This is widely used pattern in Agentic workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other important issue - how does the system Learn ?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let us say Agentic application gives a certain resolution to an incident.\n",
    "1. And the engineer verifies it to be correct.\n",
    "1. Or the engineer verifies it not be correct and knows the correct solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we enhance our agentic application with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning\n",
    "### Integrate Human Feedback\n",
    "- Whenever the Verification Agent flags a problem, route the case to an engineer for review.\n",
    "- Provide a simple thumbs-up/thumbs-down or rating interface. Feed that rating back into your store.\n",
    "- Also think of allowing general text entry field allowing engineer to enter what was done, if it was a thumbs down\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capture and store outcomes\n",
    "- Capture the above data and store it in a database\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback the data\n",
    "- Provide this data as an additional context to the debugger agent (or perhaps add another agent) which looks at this data and fine tunes the recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuously refine your agents\n",
    "- Periodically pull the best-rated incident examples (and their human-approved diagnoses) to create few-shot prompts or even fine-tune a custom model.\n",
    "- Update agent instructions based on common failure modes (e.g. “always double-check inventory data”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the other next steps could be -\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build visibility and dashboards\n",
    "- Surface the agents’ findings and verification results in a team dashboard—showing average time to diagnosis, verification pass rates, and automation success rates.\n",
    "- Use that data to spot gaps (e.g. Services that consistently fool the Debugger) and add new special-purpose agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hook into real incident streams\n",
    "- Connect the orchestration function to the monitoring/alerting system (e.g. Prometheus Alertmanager, CloudWatch Alarms, PagerDuty webhooks). Therefore every time an alert fires for “shopping-cart latency,” the agents automatically kick off the dependency→change→error→debug→verify chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future State\n",
    "- Let us imagine a state in future where there may be many agents that can gather data. In the above example it was confined to 3:\n",
    "  - discovering service dependency,\n",
    "  - looking at change log and\n",
    "  - looking at application logs.\n",
    "Let us say there are agents for metrics, anomaly detection, cluster health (for the cluster on which the service is running on etc).\n",
    "- In that case, the incident could go to a `Planner agent` that decides to breakdown the troubleshooting into steps and call agents for each steps.\n",
    "- And then hand over the summary to the Debugger Agent and Verifier agent as shown above."
