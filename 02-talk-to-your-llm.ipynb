    "In this first part of the module, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up our Python environment with the required libraries\n",
    "1. Connected to the LLM (`mistral-small`) via the OpenAI APIprovided through `ollama` and its underlying LLM runtime `llama.cpp`\n",
    "1. Generated a simple Python class using the LLM\n",
    "1. Executed the generated code to verify it works as expected\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, in Part 2 of this module, we'll explore Prompting—a fundamental skill for effectively interacting with LLMs and the foundation for developing Agentic AI applications."
